 Hey guys, I'm here again with another Speak English with me video. For those who are new, let's quickly go through how this works. Essentially, you'll be speaking English along with me. We're going to have a dialogue. I'll take one line and then you'll take the next one. I'll say my part and then you'll read yours from the screen as if you were replying directly to me. And then we swap. In today's video, we're tuning into a conversation between a bartender and a customer in a bar. So find yourself a cozy and quiet place, get ready to follow along with me, answer some questions, and don't hesitate to pause the video to practice your parts. Okay, let's get going. We'll start by listening to the entire dialogue and then we'll move on to practicing it. Hey, what's good here? Evening, our signature cocktail, the sunset margarita, is a hit. Or if you prefer beer, our local craft selections are excellent. I'll try the sunset margarita. Sounds interesting. Coming right up, you hear for any special occasion?
